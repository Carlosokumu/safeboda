### Prerequisites

Before running this app, you need to add your Github Personal Access Token, in your `local.properties` file:

```yaml
GITHUB_TOKEN="xxxx-xxxx-xxx"
```

Before every commit, make sure you run the following bash script:

```shell script
./codeAnalysis
```

To test code coverage, run the following bash script:

```shell script
./coverage
```

If you have Fastlane installed, you can run the develop lane:

```shell script
fastlane branch conf:debug
```

To check for dependency updates, run the following gradlew command:

```shell script
./gradlew dependencyUpdate
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:

### Background

Develop an application that uses Github APIs to achieve the following features:

* Search for a user profile on Github and display his account details, including, but not limited, to image, bio, username, and full name.

* Have the ability to display the user followers, and following lists. (the accounts that the user is following, and the accounts that are followed by the selected user)
